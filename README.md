## Overview
This project focuses on building and managing a robust database system by fulfilling business requirements using SQL, creating database schemas, and employing forward and backward engineering methodologies. It aims to demonstrate the complete lifecycle of database development, from requirement analysis to implementation and optimization.

## Project Features
- **Business Requirements:** Define clear, actionable requirements for database operations.
- **Schema Design:** Model the database structure using Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams.
- **Forward Engineering:** Generate database schemas and SQL scripts from the models.
- **Backward Engineering:** Reverse engineer existing databases to extract models and improve understanding.
- **Optimized SQL Queries:** Implement efficient SQL queries to meet the business requirements.

## Business Requirements
The business requirements for this project include:
1. Designing a database to manage customer, product, and order information for an e-commerce platform.
2. Ensuring referential integrity and implementing primary/foreign key relationships.
3. Creating views and stored procedures for common business operations, such as generating sales reports.
4. Supporting advanced query capabilities for analytics, such as filtering by time period, product category, and customer demographics.

## Database Schema/Modeling
The database schema is designed based on the following entities:
- **Customers**: Stores customer information, such as name, contact details, and registration date.
- **Products**: Tracks product details, including name, category, price, and stock levels.
- **Orders**: Records customer orders, including order date, status, and total cost.
- **Order Details**: Links products to orders with quantity and price information.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
Include an image or description of your ERD.

## Forward Engineering
Forward engineering includes the process of creating a new database schema and generating the SQL scripts. Key steps:
1. Translate the ERD into SQL schema definitions.
2. Implement the schema in a database management system (DBMS).
3. Write and execute scripts for constraints (primary/foreign keys) and indexes.

### Example Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    ContactDetails VARCHAR(255),
    RegistrationDate DATE
);

CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Category VARCHAR(100),
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Stock INT
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    CustomerID INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    TotalAmount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);
```

## Backward Engineering
Backward engineering includes analyzing and extracting the schema from an existing database. Key steps:
1. Use database tools to generate an ERD from the schema.
2. Document the relationships, constraints, and other design choices.
3. Modify and optimize the schema as necessary.

## Technologies Used
- **Database Management Systems (DBMS):** MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite
- **Modeling Tools:** dbdiagram.io, MySQL Workbench, or ER/Studio
- **Programming Languages:** SQL
- **Version Control:** Git

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
   ```
2. Install the required database system (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).
3. Execute the SQL scripts in the `sql_scripts` folder to set up the database.
4. Load sample data using the `sample_data` folder.
5. Use the `queries` folder to execute and test predefined SQL queries.

## Usage
- Execute the provided SQL scripts to create and populate the database.
- Use the stored procedures and queries to perform business operations.
- Generate reports and analytics as per the business requirements.
